/* ===========================================================================
   TinyPPI second-screen dashboard.

   Everything printed here comes from the snapshot TinyPPI.boot delivers; the
   labels come translated with it, out of Kodi's own string table.  The
   connection itself lives in core.js.

   One page in six tabs -- live, Dolby Vision metadata, films, series and
   history, the same five in the same order as the floating bar of the
   TinyPPI app, and the settings.  Every tab is fed from the one stream whichever is in front;
   the metadata tab draws itself (js/metadata.js) and this file hands it the
   snapshot.

   This file holds the page's frame: the tabs, the bar, the live cards, VS10
   and the report.  The libraries live in js/films.js, js/series.js and
   js/continue.js, the question a press asks in js/marking.js, and js/start.js
   starts the page once all of them are loaded.  They are classic scripts and
   share one global scope; each lists what it takes from the others.
